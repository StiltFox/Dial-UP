     * This struct is used to represent a url in a way that's easy to route. This also makes it easy to get path
     * variables and queries parameters that you need.
     *
     * - protocol - This is a string representation of the communication protocol used. IE: Http, Https, ftp, ect...
     * - host - This is the hostname included in the url. This is a string representation, but it could be an IP address
     *          or a domain name.
     * - port - This is the port number in integer form.
     * - pathSegments - This is the path (the part of the url after the first '/') broken into a vector. The segments
     *                  are loaded in the order they appear in the path. EX: https://example.com:8080/test/endpoint
     *                  would be {"test","endpoint"}.
     * - parameters - This is a map of the query parameters that appear at the end of the url after the question mark.
     *                EX: https://example.com:8080/test/endpoint?help=not_here&lost=me would be
     *                {{"help","not_here"},{"lost","me"}}.
